Adding some noteworthy competition submissions

**prashant_v5_best_submission_without_plots.ipynb** is the version that was actully selected at the close of the competition. It lacks plots (see FinalSubmission folder instead).

**prashant_v7_added_plots.ipynb** is where we added plots, but we also added many other superfluous metrics and recordings. This is the file in Final Submission folder (with a few of those superfluous recordings removed, such as noting down Top 10 steps etc.)

**prashant_v8_trying_eval_accuracy.ipynb** is where we switched to eval_accuracy in the training arguments. This did not perform better than v5/v7.

**prashant_v9_dirtying_data.ipynb** is one of the notebooks in which we tried to intentionally dirty the training data to make it more robust and able to deal with strange symbols in the test data. This did not perform better than v5/v7.
