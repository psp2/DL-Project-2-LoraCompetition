"final_notebook_with_plots" is a version of our final notebok that has plots added for the reviewerâ€™s benefit. Those are the only noteworthy differences between the code in that file and the submission we selected for the competition; all relevant configurations & parameters for the model, along with our new WeightedLoss function, are the exact same.
